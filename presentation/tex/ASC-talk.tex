\begin{frame}{Motivation}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item By:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Simulating a range of realistic stock dynamics
      \item Modelling fisheries management
    \end{itemize}
    \item We aim to:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Investigate managing two stocks as one
      \item Identify risks
      \item Suggest robust reference points
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Choosing Parameter Values}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the lh() function
    \item the gislasim function
    \item recruitment levels - ICES north sea estimates
    \item shapes designed to be viable under fishing
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Final Thoughts}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Improve simulation speed by running hadoop like program structure
    \item Test other LH parameter sets
    \item Investigate link between virgin biomass and M etc.
    \item this is being explored at the ICES WGMG in two weeks  
  \end{itemize}
